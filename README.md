# Five Band Audio Equalizer

## Project Description

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a five-band audio equalizer using analog electronics. The equalizer has the capability to divide an audio signal into five frequency bands and apply custom gain adjustments to each band. The processed frequency bands are then recombined to produce the final equalized audio signal.

The project utilizes various software tools and simulation environments to design and validate the circuit components. FilterPro was employed for designing and optimizing the Butterworth filters used in each frequency band. Multisim, a circuit simulation software, was leveraged to simulate and analyze the performance of the designed circuits before physical implementation.

The hardware implementation involved the use of operational amplifiers (op-amps), resistors, and capacitors to construct the filters and amplifier circuits. The TL072CP and NE5532P op-amps were selected for their suitability in audio applications, considering factors such as slew rate, input offset voltage, and noise performance.

For the PCB design, Altium Designer was utilized to create the schematics and layout. The enclosure for the project was designed using SolidWorks, ensuring proper integration of the PCB and other components.

Additionally, an ESP32 microcontroller and a MAX7219 LED matrix module were incorporated to provide a visual representation of the gain levels for each frequency band.
